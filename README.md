# VM-in-C
Stil in progress. 

This project implements a simple stack-based virtual machine in C that executes a custom bytecode format. It supports basic arithmetic, control flow (jumps and conditionals), and stack operations, with error handling for issues like stack overflows or division by zero etc. Programs can be loaded and saved into binary files.
